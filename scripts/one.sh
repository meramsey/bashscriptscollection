# Makes sure only one instance of the same process is running at once. This
# script does nothing if it was previously used to launch the same command
# and that instance is still running.
#
# /tmp/one-<md5sum of the arguments>.pid is used as the lock file. This file
# is removed if the process it refers to isn't actually running.
#
# Usage:   ./one.sh <command> <arguments>
# Example: ./one.sh wget --mirror http://mysite.com

# See http://patrickmylund.com/projects/one/ for more information.

# Switch out LFILE for something static to avoid running md5sum and cut, e.g.
# LFILE=/tmp/one.pid
LFILE=/tmp/one-$(echo "$@" | md5sum | cut -d\  -f1).pid
